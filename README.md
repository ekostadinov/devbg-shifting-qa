## Event Description

1. In the dynamic world of Agile environments, it is difficult to ensure that quality matches with the time and resources of each iteration / sprint

1. We will look at two approaches to help QA teams improve the quality of the products and services delivered

1. Shift left - *how* can we test in parallel with product or service development

1. Shift right - *why* we should be interested in the code and after we deliver the products or services in Production environments

1. A practical example of how to make our own monitoring solution using  `Docker`, `GitHub`, `NodeJS` and `TravisCI`

1. I will share my experience of applying these approaches for the last few years
